# 🔢 Large Integer Arithmetic Using Linked Lists in C

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains my **C implementation** for performing arithmetic operations on large integers using **doubly linked lists**. The program provides functionalities for **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** of large numbers stored as linked lists.

## 🛠 Features
- ✅ **Read large numbers from a file**
- ✅ **Store numbers using doubly linked lists**
- ✅ **Perform basic arithmetic operations:**
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (Currently commented out for debugging)
- ✅ **Print results to a file**
- ✅ **Reverse linked lists** for computation
- ✅ **Memory management with dynamic allocation and freeing**

## 📂 Contents
- 📜 **C Source Code:** Implementation of linked list operations and arithmetic functions.
- 📄 **Documentation:** Explanation of each function and its role in processing large numbers.
- 📝 **Input File (input.txt):** Contains large numbers to be processed.
- 📊 **Output File (output.txt):** Stores results of computations.

## 📌 Requirements
- C Compiler (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
- Basic knowledge of linked lists and file I/O
